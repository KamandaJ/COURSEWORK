A class called "Course" can be created, which can contain common properties such as course code, course name, and course duration.
This class can be inherited by other classes such as "ICTCourse," "LawCourse," and "BusinessCourse," which can add their own specific properties such as the course syllabus.
The BSC-IT course can be represented by creating a class called "BSCITCourse," which can inherit from the "ICTCourse" class.
The three stages of the BSC-IT course can be represented by creating three classes called "BSCITStage1," "BSCITStage2," and "BSCITStage3," which can inherit from the "BSCITCourse" class.
Using inheritance, we can create a well-structured and organized class hierarchy to represent the various courses and stages of the university.
This can assist in the capture and processing of student details by providing a consistent and structured way to store and access information about the students, their courses, and their progress.
